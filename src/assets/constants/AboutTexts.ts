    TITLE: "I'm a software engineer.",
    DESCRIPTION: `I am an engineer graduated from Grenoble-INP ENSE3 and currently based in Paris (France).
     I followed a joint program with Grenoble-INP PHELMA, focused on image and signal processing,
      with a strong emphasis on computer science and artificial intelligence. This included topics such as operating systems, C, Python, and Java programming.
Throughout my studies, I developed a strong interest in programming, particularly in web development.
 This field was introduced to me through a digital specialization track at ENSE3, as well as through my involvement
  in various associations.
My final-year internship as a Junior Fullstack Developer confirmed my desire to pursue a career
 in this field. I also continue to nurture this passion through personal projects, allowing me to deepen my technical skills.
In addition, I remain curious and actively seek to learn about other topics that inspire me,
 such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and Big Data.`,

    TITLE: 'Je suis un ingénieur logiciel.',
    DESCRIPTION: `Je suis un ingénieur diplomé de Grenoble-INP ENSE3 
      et basé à Paris (France). J'ai suivi une filière commune avec l'école Grenoble-INP PHELMA, 
      axée sur le traitement de l'image et du signal avec également une forte composante autour de 
      l'informatique et de l'IA, avec notamment de l'OS, du C, Python et Java. 
      Au fil de ma formation, j’ai développé un vif intérêt pour la programmation, et plus particulièrement pour
      le développement web. Ce domaine m’a été introduit à travers un parcours numérique au sein de l’ENSE3, ainsi
       que par mes engagements associatifs.
      Mon stage de fin d’études, en tant que développeur Fullstack Junior, a confirmé mon envie de poursuivre ma carrière dans cette voie.
      Je continue également de nourrir cette passion par des projets personnels, ce qui me permet d’approfondir mes compétences.
      En parallèle, je continue aussi de m'intéresser et me former à d'autres thématiques qui me passionnent comme l'IA, la cybersécurité ou le BigData.`,
